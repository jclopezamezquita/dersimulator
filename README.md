# Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) Simulator and measurements

A program in Python that determines the state of grid operation with distributed Energy Resources (DERs).

The DERs that can be simulated in the program are:

- Charging Stations (CS);
- Photovoltaic Systems (PS);
- Battery Energy Store System (BESS);

The load flow is run through the [dss-python] library (https://pypi.org/project/dss-python/).
